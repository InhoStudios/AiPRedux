THINGS TO ADD:
seperate walk and run speeds.
current movements are all running speeds.
...etc




BUGS TO FIX:
- happens only 5% of times when jabbing player collision onto slopes:
	- at states on ground onObject is false when it should be true, game crashes.
	
	!should be able to fix this if I create a storing variable in player and check if a new onObject is true!
